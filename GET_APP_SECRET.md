## ðŸ”§ **IMMEDIATE ACTION: Get Correct App Secret**

**The Facebook App Secret in our code is incorrect. Here's how to fix it:**

### **Step 1: Get the Real App Secret**
1. In your Facebook App settings (where you are now)
2. Find the "App secret" field 
3. **Click the "Show" button** next to the secret
4. **Copy the entire secret** (should be 32 characters)
5. **Paste it below and tell me what it is**

### **Step 2: Current Issue**
Our current secret: `fzf08facda4db47b3cc46bd8bd58c01` is causing validation errors.

The real secret should be exactly **32 characters long** and contain letters and numbers.

### **Step 3: Once You Get the Real Secret**
I'll update our `.env` file with the correct secret and test again.
